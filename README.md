# Affordable Haptic Glove for Stroke Rehabilitation

This repository presents a cost-efficient, wearable neurorehabilitation system integrating **ESP32 (Xtensa LX6 dual-core SoC)**, **flex resistive sensors**, **ERM vibration actuators**, and a **Flutter (Dart) UI layer**. The glove supports **gesture-based therapy** using embedded sensing, real-time haptics, and edge-device analytics for post-stroke hand function recovery.

---

## üß† System Architecture

The system uses **ESP32 in SoftAP mode** to form a standalone Wi-Fi network, streams **ADC-acquired flex sensor data**, and processes motor control via **PWM-regulated GPIOs**. A **Flutter mobile client** interfaces over **full-duplex WebSocket**, displaying an interactive neuro-motor training game while logging kinematic metrics locally using **Hive DB**.

## üî© Hardware Components

- **ESP32-WROOM-32 (Arduino)** ‚Äì Dual-core MCU with integrated TCP/IP stack, ADC (12-bit), and PWM timers.
- **Flex Sensors** ‚Äì Variable resistors modeled as voltage dividers for finger-angle estimation.
- **Vibration Motors (ERM)** ‚Äì PWM-driven via NPN transistor switches; feedback for motor cortex activation.
- **2N2222/BC547 + Flyback Diodes** ‚Äì Ensure safe inductive switching under motor load.
- **LM2596 Buck Converter** ‚Äì Regulates 9V input down to 3.3V logic-compatible rails.
- **9V Battery/USB** ‚Äì Mobile power for untethered use.

## üì± Software Architecture

### Embedded Firmware (ESP32 / Arduino C)
- Initializes SoftAP using `WiFi.softAP()`
- Reads flex sensor voltages on ADC1/ADC2 channels.
- Maps analog input to calibrated bend ranges.
- Manages ERM motors using `analogWrite()` for PWM modulation.
- Implements non-blocking WebSocket I/O via `WebSocketsServer`.

### Flutter App (Dart)
- Connects to ESP32's Wi-Fi AP using `dart:io`.
- WebSocket client for real-time data ingestion and actuation.
- Gesture recognition mapped to a **reaction-based game UI**.
- Stores time-series data (sensor + user response) via **Hive (NoSQL, local-first)**.
- Provides in-app telemetry with `charts_flutter`.

---

## üîÅ Communication Protocol

- Uses **WebSocket over TCP/IP** for persistent, bidirectional transport.
- Low-latency, full-duplex socket enables sensor-actuator loop closure <50ms.
- Avoids BLE pairing complexity by leveraging ESP32 SoftAP and local IP (192.168.4.1).

---

## üéÆ Gameplay-Driven Therapy

- UI simulates finger-specific visual cues (colored stimuli).
- Corresponding vibration motor triggers as haptic prompt.
- Patient bends the correct finger; ADC input validates response.
- Latency and accuracy metrics collected for each session.
- Game difficulty dynamically adjusts to motion fidelity.

---

## üìä Rehab Analytics

- Each session logs:
  - Per-finger bend range
  - Response latency
  - Missed/incorrect gestures
- Data persisted using Hive‚Äôs key-value object boxes.
- Enables offline rehab tracking without cloud integration.
- Visual analytics include:
  - Reaction time histograms
  - Finger-wise performance heatmaps
  - Weekly recovery deltas

---

## ü©∫ Clinical Relevance

- Aims to stimulate **neuroplasticity** through high-repetition, gamified exercises.
- Optimized for **home therapy** in post-stroke patients with limited access to in-clinic rehab.
- Supports **low-cost deployment** using open hardware + software (‚Çπ<1000 per unit).
- Promotes use in **physiotherapy labs**, **rural rehab camps**, and **assistive tech R&D**.
